<!-- this class name "headerSBG_SFXTrade" is the master controlling class that themes the entire page according to the different stylesheets. 
This should be a variable on the master grid and mapped to an input element in the VCM that would take three values["country", "business group name", "stylingClassname"](search below for these keynames), outputting them on the grid
**************IMPORTANT INFO: All HTML must validate according to w3c standards as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd *************
A firefox plugin: "HTML Tidy" should be installed on your browser from http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ to assist in correcting all HTML rendered, thus ensure that there is always a green check mark in the tool icon. This tool will provide solutions to fix incorrect HTML if necessary.

*******************Standard best practice rules and guidelines*******************
1. All special character entities [&, ,< , >, Â© , etc.] should always be written as [&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &copy;, etc.] when is to be presented as content from the VCM.
2. no white space should reside within a url tag eg. <a href="../standard bank.html"> The naming standard for all files should be <a href="../standardBank.html">, whereby the first word is always lower case, theeafter every adjoining word should start with an upper case.
3. All file name extension's used should be lower case "pic.jpg" and not "pic.JPG" 
4. All text elements should be wrapped in an HTML tag, paragraphs should be wrapped in <p></p> tags
5. All HTML tags must close, even single tags such as <input type="" > tags with a trailing "/" <input type="" /> as well as <img src="" /> tags
6. All HTML rendered from the VCM should exactly mirror the HTML in this page for it to display correctly. 
7. <<DO NOT FOLLOW FIREBUG>> when copying HTML, use the actual view source, as some code is dynamically generated and wrapped around elements, by the browser itself to optimize speed and loading of the pages, this keeping the file size down.
8. "id"'s should only appear once on a page, and "classNames" can be repeated.
9. Absolutely no inline styles should be used. All CSS should be contained in the head of the page.
10. All small images, icons, especially mouse overed and repeating backgrounds should be contained as a CSS sprite

					<p><strong>Accrual</strong><br />
					The apportionment of premiums and discounts on forward exchange transactions that relate directly to deposit swap (Interest Arbitrage) deals, over the period of each deal.</p>
					<p><strong>Adjustment</strong><br />
					Official action normally by either change in the internal economic policies to correct a payment imbalance or in the official currency.</p>
					<p><strong>Appreciation</strong><br />
					A currency is said to 'appreciate' when it strengthens in price in response to market demand.</p>
					<p><strong>Arbitrage</strong><br />
					The purchase or sale of an instrument and simultaneous taking of an equal and opposite position in a related market, in order to take advantage of small price differentials between markets.</p>
					<p><strong>Ask (Offer) Price</strong><br />
					The price at which the market is prepared to sell a specific Currency in a Foreign Exchange Contract or Cross Currency Contract. At this price, the trader can buy the base currency. In the quotation, it is shown on the right side of the quotation. For example, in the quote USD/CHF 1.4527/32, the ask price is 1.4532; meaning you can buy one US Dollar for 1.4532 Swiss Francs.</p>
					<p><strong>At Best</strong><br />
					An instruction given to a dealer to buy or sell at the best rate that can be obtained.</p>
					<p><strong>At or Better</strong><br />
					An order to deal at a specific rate or better.</p>
				<a href="#Top" class="back2Top">back to top</a>
			
				<a class="keyIndex" name="B" id="B">B</a>
					<p><strong>Balance of Trade</strong> <br />
					The value of a country's exports less its imports.		</p>
					<p><strong>Bar Chart</strong><br />
					A type of chart which consists of four significant points: the high and the low prices, which form the vertical bar, the opening price, which is marked with a small horizontal line to the left of the bar, and the closing price, which is marked with a small horizontal line to the right of the bar.</p>
					<p><strong>Base Currency</strong><br />
					The first currency in a Currency Pair. It shows how much the base currency is worth as measured against the second currency. For example, if the USD/CHF rate equals 1.6215 then one USD is worth CHF 1.6215. In the FX markets, the US Dollar is normally considered the 'base' currency for quotes, meaning that quotes are expressed as a unit of US$1 per the other currency quoted in the pair. The primary exceptions to this rule are the British Pound, the Euro and the Australian Dollar.</p>
					<p><strong>Bear Market</strong><br />
					A market distinguished by declining prices. </p>
					<p><strong>Bid Price</strong> <br />
					The bid is the price at which the market is prepared to buy a specific Currency in a Foreign Exchange Contract or Cross Currency Contract. At this price, the trader can sell the base currency. It is shown on the left side of the quotation. For example, in the quote USD/CHF 1.4527/32, the bid price is 1.4527; meaning you can sell one US Dollar for 1.4527 Swiss Francs.</p>
					<p><strong>Bid/Ask Spread</strong><br />
					The difference between the bid and offer price.</p>
					<p><strong>Big Figure</strong><br />
					The first two or three digits of a foreign exchange price or rate. Examples: If the USD/JPY bid/ask is 115.27/32, the big figure is 115. On a EUR/USD price of 1.2855/58 the big figure is 1.28. The big figure is often omitted in dealer quotes. The EUR/USD price of 1.2855/58 would be verbally quoted as &quot;55/58&quot;.</p>
					<p><strong>Book<br />
					</strong> In a professional trading environment, a 'book' is the summary of a trader's or desk's total positions.</p>
					<p><strong>Broker</strong><br />
					An individual or firm that acts as an intermediary, putting together buyers and sellers for a fee or commission. In contrast, a 'dealer' commits capital and takes one side of a position, hoping to earn a spread (profit) by closing out the position in a subsequent trade with another party.</p>
					<p><strong>Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944</strong><br />
					An agreement that established fixed foreign exchange rates for major currencies, provided for central bank intervention in the currency markets, and pegged the price of gold at US$35 per ounce. The agreement lasted until 1971, when President Nixon overturned the Bretton Woods agreement and established a floating exchange rate for the major currencies.</p>
					<p><strong>British Retail Consortium (BRC) Shop Price Index<br />
					</strong> Measures the rate of inflation at various surveyed retailers. This index only looks at price changes in goods purchased in retail outlets. </p>
					<p><strong>Bull Market</strong> <br />
					A market distinguished by rising prices.</p>
					<p><strong>Bundesbank</strong><br />
					Germany's Central Bank.</p>
				<a href="#Top" class="back2Top">back to top</a>
			
				<a class="keyIndex" name="C" id="C">C</a>
					<p><strong>Cable</strong><br>
					Trader jargon that refers to the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate, so called because the rate was originally transmitted via a transatlantic cable beginning in the mid 1800s.</p>
					<p><strong>Canadian Ivey Purchasing Managers (CIPM) Index</strong><br>
					This is a monthly gauge of Canadian business sentiment issued by the Richard Ivey Business School. </p>
					<p><strong>Candlestick Chart</strong><br>
					This is a chart that indicates the trading range for the day as well as the opening and closing price. If the open price is higher than the close price, the rectangle between the open and close price is shaded. If the close price is higher than the open price, that area of the chart is not shaded.</p>
					<p><strong>Carry Trade</strong><br>
					Refers to the simultaneous selling of a currency with a low interest rate, while purchasing currencies with higher interest rates. Examples are the JPY crosses such as GBP/JPY and NZD/JPY. </p>
					<p><strong>Cash Market</strong><br>
					The market in the actual financial instrument on which a futures or options contract is based. </p>
					<p><strong>CAT<br />
					</strong> Central Africa Time, or CAT, is a time zone used in central and southern Africa. The zone is two hours ahead of UTC (UTC+2), which is the same as the adjacent South Africa Standard Time and also the same as Eastern European Time.</p>
					<p>As this time zone is predominantly in the equatorial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year, so daylight saving time is not observed.</p>
					<p><strong>Central Bank</strong><br>
