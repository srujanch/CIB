<!-- this class name "headerSBG_CIB" is the master controlling class that themes the entire page according to the different stylesheets. 
This should be a variable on the master grid and mapped to an input element in the VCM that would take three values["country", "business group name", "stylingClassname"](search below for these keynames), outputting them on the grid
**************IMPORTANT INFO: All HTML must validate according to w3c standards as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd *************
A firefox plugin: "HTML Tidy" should be installed on your browser from http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ to assist in correcting all HTML rendered, thus ensure that there is always a green check mark in the tool icon. This tool will provide solutions to fix incorrect HTML if necessary.

*******************Standard best practice rules and guidelines*******************
1. All special character entities [&, ,< , >, Â© , etc.] should always be written as [&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &copy;, etc.] when is to be presented as content from the VCM.
2. no white space should reside within a url tag eg. <a href="../standard bank.html"> The naming standard for all files should be <a href="../standardBank.html">, whereby the first word is always lower case, theeafter every adjoining word should start with an upper case.
3. All file name extension's used should be lower case "pic.jpg" and not "pic.JPG" 
4. All text elements should be wrapped in an HTML tag, paragraphs should be wrapped in <p></p> tags
5. All HTML tags must close, even single tags such as <input type="" > tags with a trailing "/" <input type="" /> as well as <img src="" /> tags
6. All HTML rendered from the VCM should exactly mirror the HTML in this page for it to display correctly. 
7. <<DO NOT FOLLOW FIREBUG>> when copying HTML, use the actual view source, as some code is dynamically generated and wrapped around elements, by the browser itself to optimize speed and loading of the pages, this keeping the file size down.
8. "id"'s should only appear once on a page, and "classNames" can be repeated.
9. Absolutely no inline styles should be used. All CSS should be contained in the head of the page.
10. All small images, icons, especially mouse overed and repeating backgrounds should be contained as a CSS sprite
