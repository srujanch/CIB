					<h2>Main benefits of trading with Standard FX Trader</h2>
					<p>'And'. It's a big little word. Maybe the biggest little word there is. 'And' promises more. 'And' connects. It joins and unites to increase in quantity, quality and scale. At Standard Bank, we understand the power this little word wields – and we harness it. You see, we are all about making connections to move you forward. And the evidence is all around us. Corporate 'and' Investment Banking. Ability 'and' dedication. You 'and' Standard Bank. So when we do something, it's done, 'and' done well – 'and' we do it for you. Because without you, it doesn't matter what we offer.</p>

							<h3>Commission-free trading in currencies and spot metals with tight dealing spreads</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>At Standard FX Trader we minimise your trading costs and maximise your trading choices. We charge no trading commissions or transaction fees. Your only cost, and our only service fee, is the small difference between the bid and ask price. Tight dealing spreads (as low as one to two pips on the most widely traded currency pairs) and precise pip increments - price quotes to the fifth decimal - give you the utmost potential for gain and help you cash in on smaller price movements.</p>

							<h3>Fully automated click and deal trading on a tried and tested platform</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Standard FX Trader is supported by the US-based GAIN Capital, Forex.com UK Ltd. - a global leader in retail foreign exchange trading - and offers secure, automated and superior trading solutions. The platform&rsquo;s streamlined functionality allows you to identify and grasp market opportunities at the touch of a button.</p>
								<p>All transactions within the platform are automated enabling you to benefit from immediate quality executions. Once you click &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sell&rdquo;, our systems swiftly execute a margin check and confirm your trade.</p>
								<p>Why is automation important to you?</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Firstly, you benefit from a neutral trading environment, without subjective dealer intervention.</li>
									<li>Secondly, efficient trade processing lowers overheads and passes savings on to you in the form of tight spreads.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Our client-orientated functionality puts your unique trading strategies into action while helping you manage your risk. As soon as you enter a trade, automatic prompts will give you the option to configure both stop losses and limit orders.</p>
								<p>You can also enter orders at any price - even inside a spread - allowing you to flexibly trade around news, announcements and high market volatility. Advanced order management of this nature is important in the fast-moving forex environment where the potential for both profit and loss are great.</p>
