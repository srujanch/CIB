					<p>'And'. It's a big little word. Maybe the biggest little word there is. 'And' promises more. 'And' connects. It joins and unites to increase in quantity, quality and scale. At Standard Bank, we understand the power this little word wields – and we harness it. You see, we are all about making connections to move you forward. And the evidence is all around us. Corporate 'and' Investment Banking. Ability 'and' dedication. You 'and' Standard Bank. So when we do something, it's done, 'and' done well – 'and' we do it for you. Because without you, it doesn't matter what we offer.</p>

							<h3>South African Capital Markets Summit overview</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>In the wake of the fallout from the credit crisis, there has not been a more important time for finance professionals to share market intelligence and plan a road map for the future.</p>
								<p>The Annual South African Capital Markets Conference will this year examine the recovery and growth of the South African securitisation and debt capital markets communities.</p>
								<p>Taking place in Cape Town on 10 and 11 November, this conference will also explore and define the road ahead for international structured finance markets.</p>

							<h3>Securitisation</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Securitisation provides an alternative source of finance at a lower rate than traditional term funding, driven by the need to optimise funding and/or capital structure. By converting illiquid assets with fairly predictable cash flows into tradable financial securities, securitisation offers an attractive option for investors seeking diversification and high credit quality securities. </p>
