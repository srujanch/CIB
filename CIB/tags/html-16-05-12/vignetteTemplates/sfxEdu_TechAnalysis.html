**************IMPORTANT INFO: All HTML must validate according to w3c standards as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd *************
A firefox plugin: "HTML Tidy" should be installed on your browser from http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ to assist in correcting all HTML rendered, thus ensure that there is always a green check mark in the tool icon. This tool will provide solutions to fix incorrect HTML if necessary.

*******************Standard best practice rules and guidelines*******************
1. All special character entities [&, ,< , >, Â© , etc.] should always be written as [&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &copy;, etc.] when is to be presented as content from the VCM.
2. no white space should reside within a url tag eg. <a href="../standard bank.html"> The naming standard for all files should be <a href="../standardBank.html">, whereby the first word is always lower case, theeafter every adjoining word should start with an upper case.
3. All file name extension's used should be lower case "pic.jpg" and not "pic.JPG" 
4. All text elements should be wrapped in an HTML tag, paragraphs should be wrapped in <p></p> tags
5. All HTML tags must close, even single tags such as <input type="" > tags with a trailing "/" <input type="" /> as well as <img src="" /> tags
6. All HTML rendered from the VCM should exactly mirror the HTML in this page for it to display correctly. 
7. <<DO NOT FOLLOW FIREBUG>> when copying HTML, use the actual view source, as some code is dynamically generated and wrapped around elements, by the browser itself to optimize speed and loading of the pages, this keeping the file size down.
8. "id"'s should only appear once on a page, and "classNames" can be repeated.
9. Absolutely no inline styles should be used. All CSS should be contained in the head of the page.
10. All small images, icons, especially mouse overed and repeating backgrounds should be contained as a CSS sprite

						<li class="active">
							<h3>Lesson 401: Introduction</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<h2>What is technical analysis?</h2>
								<p>Technical analysis attempts to forecast future price movements by examining past market data. </p>
								<p>Most traders use technical analysis to get a &quot;big picture&quot; on an investment's price history. Even fundamental traders will glance at a chart to see if they are buying at a fair price, selling at a cyclical top or entering a choppy, sideways market.</p>
								<h2>Technical analysts make a few key assumptions</h2>
								<p>All market fundamentals are reflected in price data. Moods, differing opinions, and other market fundamentals need not be studied.</p>
								<p>Market history repeats itself in regular, fairly predictable patterns. These patterns, generated by price movements, are called signals. A technical analyst's goal is to uncover a current market's signals by examining past market signals.</p>
								<p>In a similar vein, prices also tend to move in trends. Technical analysts believe price fluctuations are not random and unpredictable. Once an up, down or sideways trend has been established, it usually will continue for a period.</p>
								<h2>Get in and get out at the right time</h2>
								<p>Traders rely on price charts, volume charts and other mathematical representations of market data (called studies) to find the ideal entry and exit points for a trade. Some studies help identify a trend, while others help determine the strength and sustainability of that trend over time. </p>
								<p>Technical analysis can add discipline to and minimise the emotion in your trading plan. It can be hard to screen out fundamental impressions and persist with your entry and exit points as planned. While no system is perfect, technical analysis helps you see your trading plan through more objective and dispassionate eyes.</p>
								<h2>Price chart types</h2>
								<p><strong>Bar charts</strong><br />
								Bar charts are used most frequently to display price action. Each bar represents a period of time &ndash; where a &quot;period&quot; could be as short as one minute or as long as several years. Over time, bar charts show distinct price patterns. </p>
								<p><strong>Candlestick charts</strong><br />
								Instead of a simple bar, each candlestick shows the high, low, opening and closing price for the period of time that it represents. Candlestick patterns provide greater visual detail as they develop. </p>
								<h2>Technical indicator types</h2>
								<p><strong>Trend</strong><br />
								Trend indicators smooth out price data, allowing you to easily see a persistent up, down or sideways trend. (Examples: moving averages, trend lines.) </p>
								<p><strong>Strength</strong><br />
								Strength indicators describe the intensity of market opinion on a certain price by examining the market positions taken by various market participants. Volume or open interest are the basic ingredients of strength indicators. </p>
								<p><strong>Volatility</strong><br />
								Volatility refers to the magnitude of day-to-day price fluctuations, whatever their directional trend. Changes in volatility tend to anticipate changes in prices. (Example: Bollinger Bands.) </p>
								<p><strong>Cycle</strong><br />
								Cycle indicators indicate repeating market patterns from recurrent events such as seasons or elections. Cycle indicators determine the timing of a particular market pattern. (Example: Elliott Wave.) </p>
								<p><strong>Support/resistance</strong><br />
								Support and resistance describes the price levels where markets repeatedly rise or fall and then reverse. This phenomenon is attributed to basic supply and demand. (Example: Trend Lines.) </p>
								<p><strong>Momentum</strong><br />
								Momentum indicators determine the strength or weakness of a trend as it progresses over time. Momentum is highest when a trend starts and lowest when the trend changes. </p>
								<p>When price and momentum diverge, it suggests weakness. If price extremes occur with weak momentum, it signals the end of a movement in that direction. If momentum is trending strongly and prices are flat, it signals a potential change in price direction (for example, Stochastic, MACD, and RSI).</p>

							<h3>Lesson 402: Technical indicators</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<h2>Using technical indicators</h2>
								<p>The difference between price charts and technical indicators are that charts assist in identifying trade worthy market trends - while indicators help traders to judge a trend's strength and sustainability. </p>
								<p>It is best to confirm the shift if an indicator suggests a reversal, before you act. That might mean waiting for another period to confirm the same indicator's signal, or consulting another indicator. Patience goes a long way in preparing you to you read signals accurately and respond accordingly.</p>
								<h2>Types of moving averages</h2>
								<p>As one of the most widely used indicators, moving averages helps traders to verify existing trends, identify emerging trends, and view overextended trends on the verge of reversing. As the name would suggest, a chart consists of lines overlaid on one another which &quot;average out&quot; short-term price fluctuations, in order to distinguish the long-term price trend. </p>
								<p>A simple moving average equally weights each price point over a specified period. The trader defines whether the high, low, or close is used, and these price points are added together and averaged, forming a line. </p>
								<p>A weighted moving average gives more emphasis to the latest data. It smoothes out a price curve, and at the same time makes the average more responsive to newer price changes. </p>
								<p>An exponential moving average weights more recent price data in a different way, by multiplying a percentage of the most recent price by the previous period's average price.</p>
								<h2>Finding the best moving average period for your pair</h2>
								<p>It can take a while to find the best combination of moving average and period length for your currency pair. The right arrangement will make the trend you would like clearly visible as it develops. Finding an optimal fit is called curve fitting. </p>
								<p>Usually traders start this process by comparing a few timeframes for their moving averages using a historical chart. They are then able to compare how well and how early each timeframe signalled changes in the price data as they developed, and make the necessary adjustments. </p>
								<p>When you have found a moving average that works well for your currency pair, you can consider this as a line of support for long positions or resistance for short positions. If prices cross this line, it often signals a currency is reversing course. </p>
								<p>Consider this example in support of this point: </p>
								<p>Longer-term moving averages (MAs) define a trend, but shorter-term MAs can signal its shift faster. That is why many traders watch moving averages within different timeframes at once. If a short-term MA crosses your longer term MA, it can signal that a trend is ending and that it may be time to pare back your position.</p>
								<h2>Stochastic</h2>
								<p>Stochastic studies, or oscillators, help monitor a trend's sustainability and signal reversals in prices. Stochastic come in two types, %K and %D, measured on a scale from 0 to 100. %K is the &quot;fast&quot;, more sensitive indicator, while %D is &quot;slow&quot; and takes more time to turn. </p>
								<p>Stochastic studies do not work well in choppy, sideways markets. In these conditions %K and %D lines might cross too frequently to signal anything significant.</p>
								<h2>Relative strength index</h2>
								<p>Like the stochastic, the <strong>relative strength index (RSI) </strong>measures momentum of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100. </p>
								<p>It is noteworthy to mention that RSI signals should always be confirmed with other indicators. RSI can remain at lofty or sunken levels for a long time, without prices reversing course. This simply signifies that a market is either relatively strong or weak - and is likely to remain that way for a while. </p>
								<p>Adjust your RSI to the right timeframe for you. A short-term RSI will be very sensitive and offer many signals, not all of them sustainable; a longer term RSI will be less irregular. Try to match your RSI timeframe to your own trading style: short-term works well for day traders, while longer term may suit position traders better. </p>
								<p>Divergences between prices and RSI may suggest a trend reversal. Remember to confirm any signals before acting.</p>
								<h2>Bollinger bands</h2>
								<p>Bollinger Bands are volatility curves used to identify extreme highs or lows in price. Bollinger Bands establish &quot;bands&quot; around a currency's moving average, using a set number of standard deviations around the moving average. Its creator Jon Bollinger recommends the following: </p>
								<p>Touching a high or low band does not necessarily suggest an immediate trend reversal. Bollinger Bands adjust dynamically as the volatility changes, and touching the band could simply denote that prices are extremely volatile. Use Bollinger Bands with other indicators to determine the strength of a trend.</p>
								<h2>MACD</h2>
								<p>Developed by Gerald Appel, MACD (pronounced &quot;Mac-Dee&quot;) plots the difference between 26-day and 12-day exponential MAs. </p>
								<p>A 9-day MA serves as a trigger line: when MACD crosses below the trigger line, the signal is bearish; when MACD crosses above the trigger line, the signal is bullish. </p>
								<p>If MACD becomes positive and makes higher lows while prices are still falling, this could indicate a strong buy signal. Conversely, if MACD makes lower highs while prices are reaching new highs, this could be a strong bearish divergence and a sell signal.</p>
								<h2>Fibonacci Retracements</h2>
								<p>Fibonacci retracement levels are a sequence of numbers discovered by the noted mathematician Leonardo da Pisa in the 12th century. These numbers describe cycles found throughout nature; technical analysts use them to find pullbacks in the currency market. </p>
								<p>After a significant price movement, either up or down, prices often &quot;retrace&quot; most or the entire original move. As prices retrace, support and resistance levels often occur at or near the Fibonacci Retracement levels. In terms of currencies, retracements usually happen at 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% or 61.8% of the previous move.</p>

							<h3>Lesson 403: Short-term trends</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p><em>Written by Brian Dolan (Currency Strategist at GAIN Capital Group, LLC) and Kenneth Agostino. </em></p>
								<p>The lesson below is edited from an article originally published in Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities in September 2004. </p>
								<h2>Cashing in on short-term currency trends</h2>
								<p>In reality, most of the time markets do not present a clear trend; they tend to bounce back and forth between support and resistance levels. This sideways movement is called the trading range. We discuss a strategy that can help you identify entry points on short-term trends, while protecting your profits with trailing stops.</p>
								<h2>Trade set ups</h2>
								<p>The strategy uses two charts with different time periods (10-minute and hourly), along with two technical indicators: a 200-bar moving average and a 14-bar slow stochastic study. </p>
								<p><strong>Step 1: Identify a trend </strong><br />
								Do this by comparing the moving averages on both charts. A trend may be developing when the price is consistently above or below the MAs on both charts. </p>
								<p><strong>Step 2: Pinpoint entry </strong><br />
								Once you have identified a trend, look for the following two conditions at the same time on the 10-minute chart: </p>
								<ol>
									<li>Price is no more than 20 pips above (to buy) or 20 pips below (to sell) the MA.</li>
								</ol>
								<p><strong>Step 3: Ride the trend </strong><br />
								You can do this by setting a trailing stop after the trade entry. </p>
								<p>On a LONG position, the stop order should be 10 pips BELOW the 200-period MA on the 10-minute chart. You will RAISE the stop as soon the trade turns in your favour. </p>
								<p>On a SHORT position, place the stop 10 pips ABOVE the MA. You will then LOWER the stop as soon as the trade turns in your favour.</p>
								<p>For example:</p>
								<p><strong>Step one: </strong><br />
								Start by comparing the hourly and 10-minute EUR/USD charts. Look for a time when the price is above the 200-period MAs on both charts. </p>
								<p>On the hourly chart, price is almost exclusively above the 200-hour MA, indicating a persistent uptrend.&nbsp; On the 10-minute chart, price moves (and remains above) the moving average in the last third of the chart. </p>
								<p><strong>Step two: </strong><br />
								Pinpoint the entry zone &ndash; that is when the market is within 20 pips of the MA on the 10- minute chart, and the stochastic lines cross. As indicated in the chart, conditions are right at approximately 20h00 on June 27. </p>
								<ol>
									<li>Buy EUR/USD at .9883.</li>
									<li>Protective t-stop set at .9858 (10 pips below MA).</li>
									<li>Sell EUR/USD at 0.9992.</li>
									<li>Protective t-stop has moved up to .9967.</li>
									<li>Profit = 109 pips, or US US$1090.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>It is important to note that placing contingent orders may not necessarily limit your losses.</p>

							<h3>Lesson 404: Using indicators</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<h2>Using technical  indicators</h2>
								<p>The  difference between price charts and technical indicators are that charts assist  in identifying trade worthy market trends - while indicators help traders to  judge a trend's strength and sustainability. </p>
								<p>It  is best to confirm the shift if an indicator suggests a reversal, before you  act. That might mean waiting for another period to confirm the same indicator's  signal, or consulting another indicator. Patience goes a long way in preparing  you to you read signals accurately and respond accordingly.</p>
								<h2>Types of moving  averages</h2>
								<p>As  one of the most widely used indicators, moving averages helps traders to verify  existing trends, identify emerging trends, and view overextended trends on the  verge of reversing. As the name would suggest, a chart consists of lines  overlaid on one another which &quot;average out&quot; short-term price  fluctuations, in order to distinguish the long-term price trend. </p>
								
								<p>A  simple moving average equally weights each price point over a specified period.  The trader defines whether the high, low, or close is used, and these price  points are added together and averaged, forming a line. </p>
								<p>A  weighted moving average gives more emphasis to the latest data. It smoothes out  a price curve, and at the same time makes the average more responsive to newer  price changes. </p>
								<p>An  exponential moving average weights more recent price data in a different way,  by multiplying a percentage of the most recent price by the previous period's  average price.</p>
								<h2>Finding the best  moving average period for your pair</h2>
								<p>It  can take a while to find the best combination of moving average and period  length for your currency pair. The right arrangement will make the trend you  would like clearly visible as it develops. Finding an optimal fit is called  curve fitting. </p>
								<p>Usually  traders start this process by comparing a few timeframes for their moving  averages using a historical chart. They are then able to compare how well and  how early each timeframe signalled changes in the price data as they developed,  and make the necessary adjustments. </p>
								
								<p>When  you have found a moving average that works well for your currency pair, you can  consider this as a line of support for long positions or resistance for short  positions. If prices cross this line, it often signals a currency is reversing  course. </p>
								<p>Consider  this example in support of this point: </p>
								<p>Longer-term  moving averages (MAs) define a trend, but shorter-term MAs can signal its shift  faster. That is why many traders watch moving averages within different  timeframes at once. If a short-term MA crosses your longer term MA, it can  signal that a trend is ending and that it may be time to pare back your  position.</p>
								<h2>Stochastic</h2>
								<p>Stochastic  studies, or oscillators, help monitor a trend's sustainability and signal  reversals in prices. Stochastic come in two types, %K and %D, measured on a  scale from 0 to 100. %K is the &quot;fast&quot;, more sensitive indicator,  while %D is &quot;slow&quot; and takes more time to turn. </p>
								
								<p>Stochastic  studies do not work well in choppy, sideways markets. In these conditions %K  and %D lines might cross too frequently to signal anything significant.</p>
								<h2>Relative strength  index</h2>
								<p>Like  the stochastic, the <strong>relative strength  index (RSI) </strong>measures momentum of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100. </p>
								<p>It  is noteworthy to mention that RSI signals should always be confirmed with other  indicators. RSI can remain at lofty or sunken levels for a long time, without  prices reversing course. This simply signifies that a market is either  relatively strong or weak - and is likely to remain that way for a while. </p>
								<p>Adjust  your RSI to the right timeframe for you. A short-term RSI will be very  sensitive and offer many signals, not all of them sustainable; a longer term  RSI will be less irregular. Try to match your RSI timeframe to your own trading  style: short-term works well for day traders, while longer term may suit  position traders better. </p>
								
								<p>Divergences  between prices and RSI may suggest a trend reversal. Remember to confirm any  signals before acting.</p>
								<h2>Bollinger bands</h2>
								<p>Bollinger  Bands are volatility curves used to identify extreme highs or lows in price.  Bollinger Bands establish &quot;bands&quot; around a currency's moving average,  using a set number of standard deviations around the moving average. Its  creator Jon Bollinger recommends the following: </p>
								<p>Touching  a high or low band does not necessarily suggest an immediate trend reversal.  Bollinger Bands adjust dynamically as the volatility changes, and touching the  band could simply denote that prices are extremely volatile. Use Bollinger  Bands with other indicators to determine the strength of a trend.</p>
								<h2>MACD</h2>
								
								<p>Developed  by Gerald Appel, MACD (pronounced &quot;Mac-Dee&quot;) plots the difference  between 26-day and 12-day exponential MAs. </p>
								<p>A  9-day MA serves as a trigger line: when MACD crosses below the trigger line,  the signal is bearish; when MACD crosses above the trigger line, the signal is  bullish. </p>
								<p>If  MACD becomes positive and makes higher lows while prices are still falling,  this could indicate a strong buy signal. Conversely, if MACD makes lower highs  while prices are reaching new highs, this could be a strong bearish divergence  and a sell signal.</p>
								<h2>Fibonacci  Retracements</h2>
								<p>Fibonacci  retracement levels are a sequence of numbers discovered by the noted  mathematician Leonardo da Pisa in the 12th century. These numbers  describe cycles found throughout nature; technical analysts use them to find  pullbacks in the currency market. </p>
								
								<p>After  a significant price movement, either up or down, prices often  &quot;retrace&quot; most or the entire original move. As prices retrace,  support and resistance levels often occur at or near the Fibonacci Retracement  levels. In terms of currencies, retracements usually happen at 23.6%, 38.2%,  50% or 61.8% of the previous move.</p>

								<li>Profit = 109 pips, or US US$1090.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>It  is important to note that placing contingent orders may not necessarily limit  your losses.</p>
								
								
								<h2>Using indicators to  identify trends</h2>
								<p>You  may have heard the expression &quot;the trend is your friend&quot;. But what  does it mean? If your trend takes a sudden counter-move and your trailing stop  activates at a loss, it is natural to wonder how it could be possible to select  a more useful trend the next time.</p>
								<h2>Confirm the trend  is real</h2>
								
								<p>Using  technical indicators in combination is a good habit to foster for many kinds of  technical trading, but especially in forex. It can help to ensure the  resilience of potential trend. Currencies tend to move in trends naturally due  to long-term macroeconomic factors and short-term international capital flows.  This makes it even more difficult to identify a trade-able trend that will  last.</p>
								<h2>Trend lines</h2>
								<p>From  a trader's perspective, a trend is a predictable price response at levels of  support or resistance that change over time. Trend lines mark these levels,  with support acting as the &quot;floor&quot; and resistance as the  &quot;ceiling&quot;. When prices break through either of these levels, it signals a trend that the movement is set to continue.  </p>
								<p>Hindsight  makes it easy to draw perfect trend lines on historical charts. However, it is  much tougher to be right when the trend is still developing. Nevertheless trend  lines help to focus your attention on finding support and resistance levels,  which is the first step towards identifying a new trend. </p>
								
								<p>Start  by drawing trend lines over longer timeframes (daily or weekly charts) and then  carry them forward into shorter timeframes (hourly or 4-hourly). This exercise  helps to highlight the most important support and resistance levels first so  that you do not lose sight of a major trend developing by chasing a short-term,  minor one.</p>
								<h2>Directional  Movement Index (DMI)</h2>
								<p>Developed  by J. Welles Wilder, the DMI minimises the guesswork in spotting trends and  helps confirm trend line analysis. </p>
								<p>The  DMI system has two parts: </p>
								<h2>ADX (average  directional movement index)</h2>
								<p>If  the ADX reading is above 20, it indicates a &quot;real&quot; or sustainable  trend. The ADX also measures the trend's strength: the &gt;higher the ADX, the  stronger the trend. </p>
								
								<p>The  ADX also provides an early indicator of a trend's end. When it drops from its  highest level, it may be time to exit the position and wait for a fresh signal  from the DI+/DI-. </p>
								<h2>DI+ and DI- lines</h2>
								<p>When  DI+ crosses up through DI-, it is considered a buy sign; when the opposite  happens, it usually signifies a sell sign. </p>
								<p>Wilder  recommends following the &quot;extreme point rule&quot; to confirm the signals.  Note the extreme point for that period in the direction of the crossover (the  high if DI+ crosses up over DI-; the low if DI- crosses up over DI+). Only if  that extreme point is breached in the subsequent period is a trade signal  confirmed. </p>
								<p>Many  traders use the parabolic indicator along with the ADX to identify a trend's  end. The parabolic indicator follows the price action but accelerates its own  rate of increase over time and in response to the trend. The parabolic  continually closes in on the price, and only a steadily accelerating price rise  (the essence of a trend) will prevent the price from falling below the  parabolic, signalling an end to the trend.</p>
								
								<h2>Trading short-term</h2>
								<p>The  methods above can be used for short-term decision making, even in markets that  are considered &ldquo;trendless&rdquo; &ndash; on other words, those that trade sideways.</p>
								<p>However,  if you are trading short-term, it would be unwise to entirely ignore the big  picture. There is no point in trying to ride a short-term trend that is moving  against the larger trend. </p>
