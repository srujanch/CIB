							<h3>I cannot see rates in the Standard FX Trader for web platform?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p> Several reasons could explain why you are not receiving rates on web version of Standard FX Trader.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your internet security settings may be restricting you from receiving our rates.</li>
									<li>You may need to install Microsoft Virtual Machine. </li>
									<li>Your machine may be running an older version of Internet Explorer. </li>
									<li>You may have a firewall that is restricting traffic over certain ports. </li>
									<li>Please close all open Internet Explorer windows, re-launch Internet Explorer and follow the instructions below:</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h2>1. Check your internet security settings</h2>
								<p>"High" or "Custom Level" security setting will restrict you from receiving our rates.</p>
								<p>To modify your settings:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Click on Tools (adjacent to your Favorites).</li> 
									<li>Click on Internet Options.</li>
									<li>Click on the Security tab.</li>
									<li>Choose Default Level.</li>
									<li>Click Apply.</li>
									<li>Click OK.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>2. Install the Microsoft Virtual Machine (VM)</h2>
								<p>After you do this, try to log into the trading platform. You should see a window that looks like this:</p>
								<p><img src="images/security1.jpg"/></p>
								<p>Click on the &quot;Run&quot; button to install our software, and then you should be able to see rates. If you do not get this box, please continue onto step two.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The Microsoft VM is necessary to receive our rates; it is a software component that comes with earlier versions of Windows, but has been omitted from later versions. To install it, click on the link which says:<br /> 
									Click here to install Microsoft VM. </li>
									<li>After the download, which takes approximately one minute with a broadband connection, click Yes to install the software. You will then be prompted to restart your machine. If you see the box labelled in the screenshot above, but you still do not have the rates, continue onto step three.</li>
								</ul>	
								<h2>3. Update your copy of Internet Explorer to v5.0 or later</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>To check your version of Internet Explorer, click on Help/About Internet Explorer. The browser version will be on the first line.</li>
									<li>To upgrade your version of Internet Explorer visit, http://www.microsoft.com/ie. This is a free download. </li>
									<li>Click on the Install Internet Explorer link in the centre of the page. </li>
									<li>Once the process is complete, restart your computer and try to log into the trading platform. If you still cannot see rates, continue to step four.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>4. Firewall modification</h2>
								<p>Personal PC users:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>If you have a firewall installed on your computer, it may be restricting traffic necessary for the platform to operate correctly. Firewalls may cause connectivity issues, affect access to the live rates and charting on the platform. If a firewall is installed, you will need to modify it to allow traffic on the following ports with a TCP protocol.
										<p>Destination addresses and protocols:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Port 3020/1000</li>
												<li>IP address
													<ul>
														<li>67.151.132.41</li>
														<li>67.151.132.65</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
											<ul>
												<li>Port 1000</li>
												<li>IP address
													<ul>
														<li>202.161.164.227</li>
														<li>202.161.164.238</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Most corporate users access the internet through a firewall. This is most likely the reason you cannot see our rates. Contact your network administrator if you wish to access our trading software via your corporate network.
								Please note we do not support operation behind a proxy at this time. </li>
								</ul>

							<h3>The trading platform did not automatically launch in my browser?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<ul>
									<li>When you click on the login button, the Standard FX Trader trading platform is launched into a new window, which some pop-up blockers might identify as a pop-up. In order to view the trading platform, you will have to either disable your blocker software or add Standard FX Trader to the list of sites your software will allow pop-ups to originate from. </li>
									<li>Sometimes a blocker may be installed without your knowledge. You may have to check your list of installed programmes and see if there is a programme listed that sounds like it could be a pop-up blocker. To do this, click on the Start button, and then click on Settings on Windows 98/2000, then click on Control Panel. Double-click on the Add/Remove Programmes icon, and it will display a list of the software on your computer.</li>
									<li>After checking for pop-up blocking, you can click here to try logging into the platform again with the user ID and password you received in your email.</li>
