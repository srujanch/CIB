							<h3>What is foreign exchange?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>The foreign exchange market, also referred to as the &quot;forex&quot; market, is the most traded financial market in the world, with a daily average turnover of approximately US$3.2 trillion. Forex is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. The world's currencies are on a floating exchange rate and are always traded in pairs, for example Euro/Dollar or Dollar/Yen.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Where is the central location of the forex market?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Forex trading is not centralised on an exchange, like the stock and futures markets are. The forex market is considered an over-the-counter (OTC) or 'interbank' market, because transactions are conducted between two counterparts over the telephone or via an electronic network. </p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Who are the participants in the forex market?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>The forex market is called an &rdquo;interbank&rdquo; market because in the past it has been dominated by banks, including central banks, commercial banks, and investment banks. However, the percentage of other market participants is rapidly growing, and now includes large multinational corporations, global money managers, registered dealers, international money brokers, futures and options traders, and individual investors.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>When is the forex market open for trading?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>A true 24-hour market from midnight on Sunday to midnight on Friday (CAT), forex trading begins each day in Sydney, and moves around the globe as the business day begins in each financial centre, first to Tokyo, then London, and closes in New York. Unlike any other financial market, investors can respond to currency fluctuations caused by economic, social and political events at the time they occur - day or night.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>What are the most commonly traded currencies in the forex markets?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>The most frequently traded or &ldquo;liquid&rdquo; currencies are those of countries with stable governments, respected central banks, and low inflation. Today, over 85% of all daily transactions involve trading of the major currencies, which include the US Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Swiss Franc (CHF), Canadian Dollar (CAD) and the Australian Dollar (AUD).</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Is forex trading expensive?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Standard FX Trader requires a minimum deposit of US$250. Standard FX Trader allows clients the opportunity to execute margin trades of up to 200:1 leverage. This means that investors can execute trades of $10,000 with an initial margin requirement of US$50. However, it is important to remember that while this type of leverage allows investors to maximise their profit potential, the potential for loss is equally great. A more pragmatic margin trade for someone new to the forex markets would be 20:1, but this ultimately depends on the individual investor's appetite for risk.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>What is margin?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Margin is essentially collateral for a position. It allows traders to take on leveraged positions with a fraction of the equity necessary to fund the trade. In the equity markets, the usual margin allowed is 50%, which means an investor has double the buying power. In the forex market leverage ranges from 1% to 2%, giving investors the high leverage needed to trade actively. Of course, trading on margin can increase your risk.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>What does it mean have a "long" or a "short" position?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>In trading parlance, a long position is one in which a trader buys a currency at one price and aims to sell it later at a higher price. In this scenario, the trader benefits from a rising market. A short position is one in which the trader sells a currency in anticipation that it will depreciate. In this scenario, the trader benefits from a declining market. However, it is important to remember that every forex position requires a trader to go long in one currency and short in the other.</p>

							<h3>What do terms like "bid/ask", "spread", and "rollover" mean?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Standard FX Trader has an  <a href="http://wasua1r2lz.standardbank.co.za/standardfxtrader/glossary.html" target="_blank">extensive glossary</a> that provides detailed definitions of all forex related terms.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>What is the difference between an &quot;intraday&quot; and an &quot;overnight position&quot;?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Intraday positions are all positions opened anytime during the 24-hour period AFTER the close of the New York market (17h00 ET &ndash; 23h00 CAT during US summers and 24h00 CAT during US winters). Overnight positions are positions that are still on at the end of normal <a href="trading_hours.html">trading hours</a>, which are automatically rolled by Standard FX Trader at competitive rates (based on the currencies interest rate differentials) to the next day's price.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>How are currency prices determined?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Currency prices are affected by a variety of economic and political conditions, most importantly interest rates, inflation and political stability. Moreover, governments sometimes participate in the forex market to influence the value of their currencies, either by flooding the market with their domestic currency in an attempt to lower the price, or conversely buying in order to raise the price. This is known as Central Bank intervention. Any of these factors, as well as large market orders, can cause high volatility in currency prices. However, the size and volume of the forex market makes it virtually impossible for any one entity to &quot;drive&quot; the market for any length of time.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>How do I manage my risk?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>The two most common risk management tools in forex trading are the limit order and the stop loss order. A limit order places a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price to be received. A stop loss order ensures a particular position is automatically liquidated at a predetermined price in order to limit potential losses should the market move against a trader's position. In is important to note, however, that contingent orders may not necessarily limit your risk for losses.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>What kind of trading strategy should I use?</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>Currency traders make decisions using both technical factors and economic fundamentals. Technical traders use charts, trend lines, support and resistance levels, and numerous patterns and mathematical analyses to identify trading opportunities. On the other hand, fundamentalists predict price movements by interpreting a wide variety of economic information, including news, government-issued indicators and reports, and even rumour. The most dramatic price movements however, occur when unexpected events happen. The event can range from a central bank raising domestic interest rates, to the outcome of a political election, or even an act of war. Nonetheless, more often it is the expectation of an event that drives the market rather than the event itself.</p>
