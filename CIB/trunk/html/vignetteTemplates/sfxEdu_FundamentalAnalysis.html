**************IMPORTANT INFO: All HTML must validate according to w3c standards as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd *************
A firefox plugin: "HTML Tidy" should be installed on your browser from http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ to assist in correcting all HTML rendered, thus ensure that there is always a green check mark in the tool icon. This tool will provide solutions to fix incorrect HTML if necessary.

*******************Standard best practice rules and guidelines*******************
1. All special character entities [&, ,< , >, Â© , etc.] should always be written as [&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &copy;, etc.] when is to be presented as content from the VCM.
2. no white space should reside within a url tag eg. <a href="../standard bank.html"> The naming standard for all files should be <a href="../standardBank.html">, whereby the first word is always lower case, theeafter every adjoining word should start with an upper case.
3. All file name extension's used should be lower case "pic.jpg" and not "pic.JPG" 
4. All text elements should be wrapped in an HTML tag, paragraphs should be wrapped in <p></p> tags
5. All HTML tags must close, even single tags such as <input type="" > tags with a trailing "/" <input type="" /> as well as <img src="" /> tags
6. All HTML rendered from the VCM should exactly mirror the HTML in this page for it to display correctly. 
7. <<DO NOT FOLLOW FIREBUG>> when copying HTML, use the actual view source, as some code is dynamically generated and wrapped around elements, by the browser itself to optimize speed and loading of the pages, this keeping the file size down.
8. "id"'s should only appear once on a page, and "classNames" can be repeated.
9. Absolutely no inline styles should be used. All CSS should be contained in the head of the page.
10. All small images, icons, especially mouse overed and repeating backgrounds should be contained as a CSS sprite

					<ul class="accordian">
						<li>
							<h3>Lesson 301: Fundamental analysis overview</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<h2>Introduction to fundamental analysis</h2>
								<p>Fundamental  analysis examines the core underlying elements that influence the economy of a  particular entity, like a stock or a currency. It attempts to predict trends  and price action by analysing economic  indicators, government policy, societal and other factors within a business  cycle framework.</p>
								<p> If you were to  compare the markets to a clock, fundamentals are the gears and springs that  move the hands around the face. Anyone can tell you what time it is, but the  fundamentalist knows about the inner workings that move the clock's hands  towards that time (or prices) now and in the future.</p>
								<h2>Are you a technician or a fundamentalist?</h2>
								<p>There is a tendency  to box traders into two distinct schools of thought: fundamental or technical.  In fact, most smart traders favour a blended approach  rather than being a purist of either type. </p>
								<p> Fundamentalists  need to keep an eye on signals derived from price charts, while few technicians  can afford to completely ignore impending economic data, critical political  decisions or pressing societal issues that influence price action.</p>
								<h2>Forecasting economic conditions using models</h2>
								<p> Fundamental  analysis is very effective for forecasting economic conditions, but not  necessarily as effective in predicting exact market prices. Studying GDP  forecasts or employment reports can give you a fairly clear picture of an  economy's health and the forces at work behind it, but you still need a method  to translate that into specific trade entry and exit points.</p>
								<p> The bridge between  fundamental data and a specific trading strategy usually comes from a trader  model. These models use current and historical empirical data to estimate  future prices and translate those into specific trades.</p>
								<h2>Beware of &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo;</h2>
								<p>Forecasting models  are both an art and a science. There are so many different approaches that  traders can sometimes feel overloaded. It can be difficult trying to decide  when you know enough to pull the trigger on a trade. <br />
								Many traders switch  to technical analysis at this point to test their theories and see when price  patterns suggest that an entry is viable.</p>
								<h2>Look for fundamental drivers first</h2>
								<p>The fundamentals  include everything that makes a country and its currency tick. From interest  rates and central bank policy to natural disasters, the fundamentals are a  dynamic mix of distinct plans, erratic behaviours and unforeseen  events. </p>
								<p> That said, not  every development will move a country's currency. It is helpful to start by  identifying the most influential contributors to this mix rather than following  every fundamental that occurs.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Lesson 302: Forex market drivers</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								<h2>Rising interest rates strengthen that country&rsquo;s currency</h2>
								<p>In general, most  people think about interest rates in terms of how much it costs to borrow  money, on a home loan for example, or how much could be earned on a bond or and  money market investments. Interest rate policy is a key driver of currency  prices and typically a strategy for new currency traders. </p>
								<p> Fundamentally, if a  country raises its interest rates, its currency prices will strengthen because  the higher interest rates attract more foreign investors. </p>
								<p> For example, higher  rates in the Euro zone may prompt US investors to sell US Dollars and buy bonds  in Euros. Similarly, if interest rates increase in Switzerland, those investors  may decide to sell their Euro-bonds and move into bonds in Swiss Francs,  driving Euros down and Swiss Francs up.</p>
								<h2>When gold goes up, the USD goes down (and vice versa)</h2>
								<p> Historically, gold  is a &quot;safe haven&quot;, a country-neutral investment and an alternative to  the world's other reserve currency, the US Dollar. That means gold prices have  an inverse relationship to the USD, offering several ways for currency traders  to take advantage of that relationship. </p>
								
								<p> For example, if  gold breaks an important price level, you would expect gold to move higher.  With this in mind, you might sell dollars and buy Euros, for example, as a  proxy for higher gold prices.</p>
								<h2>Rising gold prices help major gold producers</h2>
								<p>Canada is the third  largest producer of gold worldwide, while Australia is the world's third  largest exporter. These two major currencies tend to strengthen as gold prices  rise. You might consider going long on these currencies when gold is increasing  in value, or trade your GBP or JPY for these currencies when gold is on the  rise.</p>
								<h2>Oil dependant countries&rsquo; currencies weaken as the oil  price rise</h2>
								
								<p>When trading, if  you believe oil prices will continue to rise, you could consider buying  commodity-based economies like Australia or Canada or selling oil-dependent  currencies.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Lesson 303: Economic indicators</h3>
							<div class="panel">
								 <h2>What are economic indicators?</h2>
								<p>Economic indicators  are snippets of financial and economic data published regularly by governmental  agencies and organisations within the private sector. These statistics help  market observers monitor the economy's pulse, which is why they are loyally  followed by almost everyone in the financial markets. </p>
								<p> Since so many  people are poised to react to the same information, economic indicators have  tremendous potential to generate volume and to move prices. Although it might  seem at times like you need an advanced economics degree to analyse this data  accurately &ndash; in reality traders only need to keep a few simple guidelines in  mind when making trading decisions.</p>
								<h2>Mark your economic calendars</h2>
								<p> It is helpful to  diarise the exact date that each economic indicator will be released. Standard  FX Trader clients can simply login to &lsquo;MyAccount&rsquo; and click on economic calendars  for this information. </p>
								
								<p> Keeping an eye on  the economic calendar not only helps you consider trades around these events, it  helps explain otherwise unanticipated price actions during those periods. </p>
								<p> Consider this illustration:  on a Monday, with the USD having been in a tailspin for three weeks, many  traders have short USD positions. That Friday, however, US employment data is  scheduled to be released and the report looks promising. As a result, traders  may start unwinding their short positions before Friday, leading to a  short-term rally in USD through the week.</p>
								<h2>What does this data mean for the economy?</h2>
								<p>It is not necessary  to understand every nuance of each data release, but it may be worthwhile to  try to grasp key, large-scale relationships between reports and what they  measure in the economy: for instance, knowing which indicators measure the  economy's growth (gross domestic product, or GDP) versus those that measure  inflation (PPI, CPI) or employment strength (non-farm payrolls).</p>
								<h2>Not all economic indicators move the market</h2>
								
								<p>The market is known  to pay more attention to certain indicators under certain conditions - and that  focus can change over time. For example, if prices (inflation) are not a  crucial issue for a given country, but its economic growth is problematic,  traders may pay less attention to inflation data and rather tend to focus on  employment data or GDP reports.</p>
								<h2>Look out for the unexpected</h2>
								<p>Frequently the data  itself may not be as important as whether or not it meets market expectations.  If a given report differs widely and unexpectedly from what economists and  market pundits were anticipating, market volatility and potential trading  opportunities are usually the result. </p>
								<p> At the same time,  it is prudent to be cautious of acting too quickly when an indicator falls  outside expectations. Each new release of an economic indicator contains  revisions to previously released data.</p>
								<h2>Try not to get bogged down in the details</h2>
								
								<p>While it may be  important for an economics professor to appreciate all the nuances of an economic  report, traders should filter data judiciously for their own purposes: thereby  making intelligent trading decisions. <br /><br />
								For example, many  new traders watch the headlines of new employment reports, for example,  assuming that new jobs are vital for economic growth. That may be true  generally, but in trading terms non-farm payrolls is the figure traders watch  most closely and therefore has the biggest impact on markets.</p>
								<h2>There are two sides to every trade</h2>
								<p>Hopefully our  discussion has helped you realise the importance of watching economic  indicators - and knowing which data are most likely to move markets and impact  currency traders. </p>
								<p> No trader's  knowledge can be complete all the time. Although you may closely follow and  understand the impact of economic data published in the US - there may be times  when data published in Europe or Australia will have a surprising impact on  your currency market. Doing your homework before trading any currency will help  you guard against unnecessary risks.</p>
								
								<h2>Economic  indicators: a currency's vital signs</h2>
								<p> Traders can  measure the economic health of a given country (and its currency) through its  economic indicators &ndash; but bear in mind that not all statistics count equally. A  few of the key economic indicators that often impact currency traders are  covered below. </p>
								<p> Economic  indicators can be divided into leading and lagging indicators: </p>
								<ol>
								<li><strong>Leading indicators</strong> are economic factors that change BEFORE the economy starts to follow a particular trend. They are  used to predict changes in the  economy. </li>
								
								<li><strong>Lagging indicators</strong> are economic factors that change  AFTER the economy has already  begun to follow a particular trend. They are used to confirm changes in the economy. </li>
								</ol>
								<h2>Major economic indicators</h2>
								<p><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong><br />
								GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced  either by domestic or foreign companies. GDP indicates the pace at which a  country's economy is growing (or declining) and is considered the broadest  indicator of economic output and growth.</p>
								<p><strong>Industrial Production</strong><br />
								
								A measure of the change in the production of the  nation's factories, mines and utilities, industrial production also measures the  country's industrial capacity and the extent to which it is being used (otherwise  known as capacity utilisation). </p>
								<p>The manufacturing sector accounts for a quarter of  the major currencies' economies, so it is critical to watch the health of  factories and whether their capacity is being maximised. </p>
								<p><strong>Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)</strong><br />
								The National Association of Purchasing Managers  (NAPM), now called the Institute for Supply Management, releases a monthly  composite index of national manufacturing conditions. The index includes data  on new orders, production, supplier delivery times, backlogs, inventories,  prices, employment, export and import orders. It is divided into manufacturing  and non-manufacturing sub-indices. </p>
								<p><strong>Producer Price Index (PPI)</strong><br />
								This indicator measures average changes in selling  prices received by domestic producers in the manufacturing, mining,  agriculture, and electric utility industries.</p>
								
								<p>The PPIs most often used for economic analysis are  those for finished goods, intermediate goods, and crude goods.</p>
								<p><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong><br />
								CPI measures the average price level paid by urban  consumers (making up 80% of the population in major currency countries) for a  fixed basket of goods and services. It reports price changes in over 200  categories.<br />
								The CPI also includes various user fees and taxes  directly associated with the prices of specific goods and services.</p>
								<p><strong>Durable Goods</strong><br />
								Durable Goods Orders measures new orders placed  with domestic manufacturers for immediate and future delivery of factory hard  goods. A durable good is a product that lasts longer than three years, during  which its services are extended.</p>
								
								<p>Companies and consumers sometimes put off purchases  of durable goods during tough economic times, and can therefore be a useful  measure of certain kinds of customer demand.</p>
								<p><strong>Retail Sales</strong><br />
								Retail Sales measures total receipts of retail  stores from samples representing all sizes and kinds of business in retail  trade throughout the nation. It is the timeliest indicator of broad consumer  spending patterns and is adjusted for normal seasonal variation, holidays, and  trading-day differences.</p>
								<p>Retail sales include durable and nondurable  merchandise sold, and services and excise taxes incidental to the sale of  merchandise. It does not include sales taxes collected directly from the  customer.</p>
								<p><strong>Housing Starts</strong><br />
								
								This indicator measures the number of residential  units that begin construction each month. A &quot;start&quot; refers to  excavation of the foundation of a residential home.</p>
								<p>Housing is usually one of the first sectors to  react to interest rate changes. Significant reaction of start/permits to  changing interest rates signals interest rates are nearing their trough or  peak. You can analyse the data by focusing on the percentage change in levels  from the previous month. The report is released towards the middle of the  following month.</p>
